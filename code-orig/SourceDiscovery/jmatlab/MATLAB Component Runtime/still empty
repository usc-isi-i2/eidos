To run the demo, a version of Matlab must be installed, or the 
Matlab Component Runtime.

IMPORTANT: the test dll (matlabtest.dll) was compiled for use
with the Matlab Runtime v71. If another Runtime  (or Matlab version)
is being used, then the dlls must be compiled to the new Runtime 
first, see the directory matlabtest_sources.
